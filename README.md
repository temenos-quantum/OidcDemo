# OpenID Connect Demo

A sample [Visualizer](https://www.kony.com/products/visualizer/) project demonstrating how to integrate an **OpenID Connect (OIDC)**
or **Oauth2.0** identity provider —specifically [Okta](https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/oidc/)— into a [Temenos Quantum](https://www.kony.com/) app.

This project is meant as supporting material to a two-part series of articles on the subject of **OIDC and Oauth2.0 integration**,
which can be found at [Temenos Base Camp](https://basecamp.temenos.com):
